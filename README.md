## 📖 Introduction
This project is part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** coursework for the Computer Science degree. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the key OOP principles, such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**, by implementing a real-world application.

## ✅ Features
- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its data and methods, ensuring controlled access.
- **Inheritance**: Common functionality is inherited from base classes, reducing code duplication.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods are overridden to provide specific functionality in different contexts.
- **Abstraction**: Complex logic is hidden behind user-friendly interfaces.

## 💻 Technologies
- **Java**: The core programming language used to implement the project.
- **IDE**: [Specify if you used an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code.]
